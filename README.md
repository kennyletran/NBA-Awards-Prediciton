# Making Subjective NBA Awards Objective: Predicting NBA End-of-Season Awards with Statistics

This project implements machine learning and data analytics methodologies to predict winners of five individual, end-of-season NBA Awards. 

## Project Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create an objective prediction model for each of the 5 main NBA Awards: Most Valuable Player (MVP), 6MOY (6th Man of the Year), DPOY (Defensive Player of the Year), ROY (Rookie of the Year), and MIP (Most Improved Player).

## Model Algorithms and Methods Used
Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Lasso Regression
Random Forest

## Technologies and Packages Used
R, Python, Jupyter Notebook
Python: NumPy, Pandas, Sklearn, Matplotlib, StatsModels API
R: dplyr, glmnet, stringi

## Usage
The following steps should be taken to run the four regression models:
Start with The NBA Awards Data Cleaning file 
Contains a step-by-step guide on the process and tools used to clean the data, including string manipulation, filtering, and handling missing variables. It can be run by downloading the nbaStats[Year].csvs. 
Create MIP data 
MIP Creation file provides the code for this 
Choose your fighter (model), and load the data in (all the files includes commented code explaining each part):
